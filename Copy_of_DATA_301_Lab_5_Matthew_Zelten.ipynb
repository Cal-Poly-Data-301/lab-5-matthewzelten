        "\n",
        "The _Federalist Papers_ were a set of 85 essays published between 1787 and 1788 to promote the ratification of the United States Constitution. They were originally published under the pseudonym \"Publius\". Although the identity of the authors was a closely guarded secret at the time, most of the papers have since been conclusively attributed to one of Hamilton, Jay, or Madison. The known authorships can be found in `https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/federalist/authorship.csv`.\n",
        "\n",
        "For 15 of the papers, however, the authorships remain disputed. (These papers can be identified from the `authorship.csv` file because the \"Author\" field is blank.) In this analysis, you will use the papers with known authorship to predict the authorships of the disputed papers. The text of each paper is available at `https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/federalist/x.txt`, where `x` is the number of the paper (i.e., a number from 1 to 85). The name of the file indicates the number of the paper."

        "\n",
        "When analyzing an author's style, common words like \"the\" and \"on\" are actually more useful than rare words like \"hostilities\". That is because rare words typically signify context. Context is useful if you are trying to find documents about similar topics, but not so useful if you are trying to identify an author's style because different authors can write about the same topic. For example, both Dr. Seuss and Charles Dickens used rare words like \"chimney\" and \"stockings\" in _How the Grinch Stole Christmas_ and _A Christmas Carol_, respectively. But they used common words very differently: Dickens used the word \"upon\" over 100 times, while Dr. Seuss did not use \"upon\" even once.\n",

              "'To the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nAFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting\\nfederal government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new\\nConstitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its\\nown importance; comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the\\nexistence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it\\nis composed, the fate of an empire in many respects the most interesting\\nin the world. It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been\\nreserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example,\\nto decide the important question, whether societies of men are really\\ncapable or not of establishing good government from reflection and\\nchoice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their\\npolitical constitutions on accident and force. If there be any truth\\nin the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be\\nregarded as the era in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong\\nelection of the part we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be\\nconsidered as the general misfortune of mankind.\\n\\nThis idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of\\npatriotism, to heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good\\nmen must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be\\ndirected by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and\\nunbiased by considerations not connected with the public good. But this\\nis a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The\\nplan offered to our deliberations affects too many particular interests,\\ninnovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its\\ndiscussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views,\\npassions and prejudices little favorable to the discovery of truth.\\n\\nAmong the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution\\nwill have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest\\nof a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which\\nmay hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of\\nthe offices they hold under the State establishments; and the perverted\\nambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize\\nthemselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter\\nthemselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of\\nthe empire into several partial confederacies than from its union under\\none government.\\n\\nIt is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this\\nnature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve\\nindiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their\\nsituations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious\\nviews. Candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated\\nby upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the\\nopposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its\\nappearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not\\nrespectable--the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived\\njealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes\\nwhich serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many\\noccasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right\\nside of questions of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance,\\nif duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those\\nwho are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any\\ncontroversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might\\nbe drawn from the reflection that we are not always sure that those\\nwho advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their\\nantagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,\\nand many other motives not more laudable than these, are apt to operate\\nas well upon those who support as those who oppose the right side of a\\nquestion. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing\\ncould be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all\\ntimes, characterized political parties. For in politics, as in religion,\\nit is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword.\\nHeresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.\\n\\nAnd yet, however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have\\nalready sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all\\nformer cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and\\nmalignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the\\nopposite parties, we shall be led to conclude that they will mutually\\nhope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the\\nnumber of their converts by the loudness of their declamations and the\\nbitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy\\nand efficiency of government will be stigmatized as the offspring of a\\ntemper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty.\\nAn over-scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,\\nwhich is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be\\nrepresented as mere pretense and artifice, the stale bait for popularity\\nat the expense of the public good. It will be forgotten, on the one\\nhand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love, and that the noble\\nenthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and\\nilliberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that\\nthe vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that,\\nin the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their\\ninterest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more\\noften lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the\\npeople than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and\\nefficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been\\nfound a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than\\nthe latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties\\nof republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying\\nan obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending\\ntyrants.\\n\\nIn the course of the preceding observations, I have had an eye, my\\nfellow-citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts,\\nfrom whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the\\nutmost moment to your welfare, by any impressions other than those which\\nmay result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the same\\ntime, have collected from the general scope of them, that they\\nproceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes,\\nmy countrymen, I own to you that, after having given it an attentive\\nconsideration, I am clearly of opinion it is your interest to adopt it.\\nI am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your\\ndignity, and your happiness. I affect not reserves which I do not feel.\\nI will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation when I have\\ndecided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely\\nlay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness\\nof good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not, however, multiply\\nprofessions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of\\nmy own breast. My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by\\nall. They shall at least be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace\\nthe cause of truth.\\n\\nI propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting\\nparticulars:\\n\\nTHE UTILITY OF THE UNION TO YOUR POLITICAL PROSPERITY THE INSUFFICIENCY\\nOF THE PRESENT CONFEDERATION TO PRESERVE THAT UNION THE NECESSITY OF\\nA GOVERNMENT AT LEAST EQUALLY ENERGETIC WITH THE ONE PROPOSED, TO THE\\nATTAINMENT OF THIS OBJECT THE CONFORMITY OF THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION\\nTO THE TRUE PRINCIPLES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT ITS ANALOGY TO YOUR\\nOWN STATE CONSTITUTION and lastly, THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY WHICH ITS\\nADOPTION WILL AFFORD TO THE PRESERVATION OF THAT SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT,\\nTO LIBERTY, AND TO PROPERTY.\\n\\nIn the progress of this discussion I shall endeavor to give a\\nsatisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their\\nappearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.\\n\\nIt may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the\\nutility of the UNION, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts\\nof the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be\\nimagined, has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear\\nit whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new\\nConstitution, that the thirteen States are of too great extent for\\nany general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate\\nconfederacies of distinct portions of the whole.(1) This doctrine will,\\nin all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough\\nto countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident,\\nto those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the\\nalternative of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment\\nof the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the\\nadvantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers,\\nto which every State will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall\\naccordingly constitute the subject of my next address.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n1. The same idea, tracing the arguments to their consequences, is held\\nout in several of the late publications against the new Constitution.'"
